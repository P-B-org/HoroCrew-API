These people usually can't see anyone else taking the front seat in their presence. Thus competitiveness, even in a relationship, is inevitable.

They express this belief by volunteering in animal shelters, soup kitchens and anywhere community support is required - it's this platform that often creates enduring friendship. Alternatively, they are likely to work in health or social serves and become close through sharing similar personal philosophies although not necessarily methodology - Cancer is conventional and old school when it comes to medical and physiological practices whereas Pisces comes to the relationship armed with crystals, runes and Shaman training.",

When two such majestic creatures come together to form a bond, they command the attention of all the people around them. It is almost as if a spectacle has been put up by two gregarious individuals who deserve each other. A Leo and Leo couple enjoys the strong spirit of each other. As they find themselves drunk in the passion of each other, they also do not shy away from revealing their desires for each other. The splendour of a Leo-Leo love is apparent from the enthusiasm which they share among each other, each contributing as much as the other. This strong relationship truly speaks volumes of Leo and Leo compatibility. Both of them, no matter how introverted they are, is capable of socializing and therefore establishing their relationship among their social circles with ease. And when things get difficult, they can feed off of each other's confidence. However, despite the grandeur of Leo and Leo love, they can find themselves offsetting at times. Leos are a self-centred bunch who can offer a lot of passion and love for their partners so long as their ego is fed which begs the question of whose life revolves around who in this relationship. This can prove to be quite strenuous for both Leos.",

In a Leo-Leo friendship, this conviction is often useful to each other as they can regain their confidence from the other's conviction. Leos are also terrific when it comes to trust. In most cases, Leos can readily sacrifice themselves for their friendship. However, this act rarely comes from a place of deep love and affection. Rather, it comes from their conviction of a perfect friendship that they have in their minds. They are also bad liars which can make them difficult in situations where a white lie might come in handy. All in all, Leo and Leo friendship compatibility is great as long as mistrust does not creep in due to external factors. Their ego is too inflated to confront one another and their inability to lie does not help either.",

This relationship evolves gradually as the partners become understanding and appreciating. Leo is extroverted, dominant, and charismatic, and sometimes features, what can be considered a short fuse. Virgo is studious and withdrawn and possesses more versatility than Leo. Although there are differences, Leo and Virgo couple creates an exquisite marriage when each partner warms up to the other's unfamiliar style. At times, Leo could seem tyrannical, and Virgo could seem too judgmental.

Virgo teaches Leo patience and enables him/her to set their intellect in order. However, Leo and Virgo friends might repel each other at times. This often happens when Leo's overbearing nature of constantly wanting to be in the spotlight disrupts Virgo's haven when it is absolutely necessary for Virgo. Leo and Virgo friendship compatibility, therefore, boils down to Leo's ability to control his/her enthusiasm and be wary of the surrounding.",

It is common knowledge that fires blaze suddenly and burns everything around, metaphorically and literally. On the other hand, earth characterizes composure. They take their time to build things up which is completely the opposite of what Leos do and how they are. In a Leo-Scorpio love match, Leo's love is expressed in their emotions which like to engulf their partners suddenly. They expect their partners to succumb to this power.

Leo and Aquarius love compatibility can be considered as one of the best among the zodiacs. Leo's dignity and zeal charm Aquarius while Aquarius' individualism and prudence are admired by Leo.

With water as their element, Pisces on the other hand is considerably reserved, quiet and introspective. Their vivid differences attract one another but Leo-Pisces love matches often end up finding each other mundane after spending some time with each other. Leo and Pisces compatibility is also dependent on the fact that they are both dreamers who can fill the voids that they may carry. Further, in a Leo and Pisces love life, the former can end up acting like a guardian to the quiet Pisces. Although this isn't necessarily bad, it can rile up Pisces as they do not like to be considered weak. The worse thing is, despite their displeasure, Pisces might choose to not speak up which only increases the chances for things to get worse in the future.

Pisces, on the other hand, dislikes Leo's conceited behaviour. Further, Pisces, although quite agreeable and likes to do almost anything to be likeable, hates working under a boss. Unfortunately, Leos love to boss people around and considers themselves as the leader in any relationship.

They understand what makes each other uncomfortable and seldom ask these things from their partners. They are sincere in their love as well. Another crucial element among Libra and Libra couples is that they are the happiest when they have someone to share their interests with.

In a Libra-Scorpio relationship, the latter tends to brood over trivial things and get lost in their own emotions. This can turn out to be problematic for them if they wish to sustain a long relationship. It is a good thing that Libra has the conviction and personality which can pacify the tempestuous emotions of a Scorpio. While Libra helps Scorpio to get a hold of their emotions, the latter helps the other one out by offering their focus which is something Libras often lack. Libra and Scorpio love matches have the proclivity to balance each other out through Libra's need for connection and warmth and Scorpio's tendency to thrive on emotional intimacy. Both Libra and Scorpio are loyal signs which seldom do anything to hurt their partners. However, they can compromise their relationship through their differentiating perspectives on love and responsibilities. While Scorpio believes in being patient and wait for the right opportunity to show their fondness for their partners, Libra on the other hand likes to live in the moment. They will show their love for their partners whenever and wherever they feel like it. This difference can cause some tension between the two. Another hurdle that a Libra and Scorpio couple can come across is the difference in their values. Libras are free-spirits who does not like to be chained to anything or anybody, including their partners, so when Scorpios try to control them, things can quickly go awry.",

Libra-Scorpio friendship is however slightly more complicated than just head and heart. They are both ruled by planets with completely different traits associated with them. While one is more inclined towards emotional connection, the other gravitates more towards romanticism and aesthetics. This slightly decreases the Libra and Scorpio friendship compatibility as they often fail to find something common that they wish to talk about. For Libra, a Scorpio can be quite useful as they provide useful insights into the process of tackling a problem through their systematic approach. However, they can be equally annoying due to their outbursts of emotions which are challenging for a Libra to deal with. On the flip side, Libra can turn out to be quite provoking behind their free-spirited attitude. While the latter attribute helps bring excitement to a Scorpio's life, the former kills the moment as they are left flustered and stirred up. It is only through Libra's diplomacy that they can both get through their differences. Another problem for a Libra and Scorpio friendship is that Libra often brings up new things for them to enjoy together and move on to newer things almost immediately, leaving Scorpio alone as they have the habit of finishing what they started no matter what.",
